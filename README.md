## 🛠 Tech Stack:  
- **Express.js** – For handling server-side logic and API requests  
- **Node.js** – As the runtime environment
- **PostgreSQL** - For database access  



## 📌 What I Learned  
While building this project, I learned:  
- How to create **CRUD operations** using **Express.js**.  
- How to **extract parameters** from the **URL (`req.params`)** and **query string (`req.query`)**.  
- How to handle **data from request body (`req.body`)** when working with POST and PUT requests.  
- How to test API endpoints using **Thunder Client**. 
- How to connect database using **PostgreSQL**. 
- How to send and fetch data to database using queries.

This project was a great opportunity to practice **Express.js routing, middleware, and backend development**. 🚀
