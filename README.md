# YaNotes App 📝  

**YaNotes** is a basic web application for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. It was built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** as part of my learning journey in **Express** and RESTful API development.  
<br>

## ✨ Features:  
- ✅ **Add Notes** with a title and content  
- ✅ **View All Notes** stored in the database  
- ✅ **Edit Notes** easily  
- ✅ **Delete Notes** when no longer needed  
<br>

## 🛠 Tech Stack:  
- **Express.js** – For handling server-side logic and API requests  
- **Node.js** – As the runtime environment   



This project was a great opportunity to practice **CRUD operations** and gain hands-on experience with **Express.js** and backend development. 🚀

##     
**CRUD** stands for "Create, Read, Update, Delete", the four basic operations for managing data.
