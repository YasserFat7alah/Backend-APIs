# YaNotes App 📝  

**YaNotes** is a basic web application for creating, reading, updating, and deleting notes. It was built using **Node.js** and **Express.js** as part of my learning journey in **Express** and RESTful API development.

## ✨ Features:  
- ✅ **Add Notes** with a title and content  
- ✅ **View All Notes** stored in the database  
- ✅ **Edit Notes** easily  
- ✅ **Delete Notes** when no longer needed  
<br>

## 🛠 Tech Stack:  
- **Express.js** – For handling server-side logic and API requests  
- **Node.js** – As the runtime environment   



## 📌 What I Learned  
While building this project, I learned:  
- How to create **CRUD operations** using Express.js.  
- How to **extract parameters** from the **URL (`req.params`)** and **query string (`req.query`)**.  
- How to handle **data from request body (`req.body`)** when working with POST and PUT requests.  
- How to test API endpoints using **Thunder Client**.  

This project was a great opportunity to practice **Express.js routing, middleware, and backend development**. 🚀

##     
**CRUD** stands for "Create, Read, Update, Delete", the four basic operations for managing data.
